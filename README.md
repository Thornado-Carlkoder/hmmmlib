# Hidden Markov-Model Library

* HMM library written in c++ 
* Has Python bindings allowing it to be used by Python as well
* The library should be made in a modular way such that the user can easely add functionalities


## GOAL

The goal of this project is:

	- To get a strong theoretical understanding of HMM's and different versions of the latter
	- Create a robust and easy to use libeary for both c++ and python
	- After finishing the initial project make it open source for everyone to add and use

## DOCUMENTATION

In this section all the documentation for the libeary is written as well as the different papers thathave been implemented.
